      <p><strong>What React is:</strong> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
      <p><strong>Who created it:</strong> It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (Facebook).</p>
      <p><strong>Year it was created:</strong> 2011</p>
      <p><strong>Year it was publicly released:</strong> 2013</p>
      <p><strong>Why React is a library:</strong> React focuses only on the UI layer, not every feature like routing or state management. That makes it a library, not a full framework.</p>
